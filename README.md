# Coptering
Parallax Microcontroller using Mavlink

This project uses a microcontroller to read the the position off one copter and send that
information to a second copter.  That second copter will change it position to match the 
first copter.

Only height has been implemented at this point but shows how to consume Mavlink messages
and build new ones to send to the second copter.
